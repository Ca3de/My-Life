# Asset placeholders

Add the following image files to complete the visual presentation:

- `israel-oladeji` portrait (preferred `jpg`, but `jpeg`, `png`, or `webp` work as well).
- `morawatch` app icon (preferred `png`, but `jpg` or `webp` are also supported).
- `all-saints-online` app icon (preferred `png`, but `jpg` or `webp` are also supported).

These images are optional at runtime; if they are not present the layout will automatically fall back to gradient-based placeholders. When you are ready, place the optimized images (preferably square PNGs for the app icons and a portrait JPG for the hero) in this folder.
