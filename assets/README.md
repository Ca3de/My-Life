# Asset placeholders

Add the following image files to complete the visual presentation:

- `israel-oladeji` portrait (preferred `jpg`, but `jpeg`, `png`, or `webp` work as well).
- `morawatch` app icon (preferred `png`, but `jpg` or `webp` are also supported).
- `all-saints-online` app icon (preferred `png`, but `jpg` or `webp` are also supported).

These images are optional at runtime; if they are not present the layout will automatically fall back to gradient-based placeholders. When you are ready, place the optimized images (preferably square PNGs for the app icons and a portrait JPG for the hero) in this folder.

## How to collect the artwork

1. Open each App Store listing in a desktop browser:
   - Morawatch: <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/morawatch/id6752028378>
   - All Saints Online: <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/all-saints-online/id6746954455>
2. In the left sidebar, right-click the large app icon and choose “Save Image As…” to download the official 1024×1024 PNG.
3. Rename the downloaded files to `morawatch.png` and `all-saints-online.png` before copying them into this folder. (The page will also accept `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.webp` versions if you prefer another format.)
4. For the portrait, drop your headshot into this folder as `israel-oladeji.jpg`. If your file uses a different extension, keep the base name (`israel-oladeji`) and the site will automatically try `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`, and uppercase variants.

> ⚠️ File names on the web are case-sensitive. Stick to lowercase names (e.g., `morawatch.png`, not `MoraWatch.PNG`) to guarantee the images load everywhere.
