# Asset placeholders

Add the following image files to complete the visual presentation:

- `israel-oladeji.jpg` – Hero portrait displayed beside the introduction.
- `morawatch.png` – App icon for the Morawatch feature card.
- `all-saints-online.png` – App icon for the All Saints Online feature card.

These images are optional at runtime; if they are not present the layout will automatically fall back to gradient-based placeholders. When you are ready, place the optimized images (preferably square PNGs for the app icons and a portrait JPG for the hero) in this folder.
